A collection of opinionated tools to work well with [ecodev/graphql-doctrine](https://github.com/Ecodev/graphql-doctrine) and [@ecodev/natural](https://github.com/Ecodev/natural). 

## Quick start

Install the library via composer:

```sh
composer require ecodev/felix
```

## Non-goals

This is not a flexible or complete framework. It is common pieces of code for a
specific purpose. It is not meant to be generic.

If code is becoming too complex to adapt to all use-cases, then we should instead
consider implementing it in the application itself instead ot this library.
